### WakeMe Crypto

WakeMeCrypto is a decentralized application (DApp) built on the Ethereum blockchain, creating a unique and rewarding wake-up experience. Users can set alarms by staking Ethereum, with successful wake-ups resulting in the retrieval of the staked amount. Failure to wake up within the specified time leads to the loss of the staked Ethereum.

npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network mumbai
```

## Usage

1. Connect your Ethereum wallet using ConnectKit.

2. Set alarms by staking Ethereum.
3. Successfully waking up (Stop Alarm) reclaims your staked amount.
4. Failure to wake up within the specified time results in the loss of the staked Ethereum.
